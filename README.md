BASE_DIR of main.py and step2_test.py needs to be adapted

step2_test.py produces the proposed sequences using the reduced actual sequences and stores them in data/proposed_sequences_step2
these sequences can be scored using main.py and are saved in data/test_scores

other required inputs can be found in the data folder
